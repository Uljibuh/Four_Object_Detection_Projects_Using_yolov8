# Four Object Detection Projects Using Yolo
Yolo Basics, Yolo Webcam, Car Counter, Construction_Safety_Detection.
 
These projects were done by following Youtuber "Murtaza's Workshop - Robotics and AI"

Please check out his videos, its amazing.

What I learned:

1, Learned how to set up 
   virtual environment in python.

2, Learned Yolo basics and 
   how to use webcam in 
   computer vision task, 
   and detect object from Images.

3, In car counter project, 
   learned how to make and 
   use Mask in the video 
   in order to count 
   the number of
   cars on the road.

4, In last project, 
   I trained Yolov8 using 
   public dataset 
   on Google-Colab, 
   and Then using 
   trained model detect 
   the Constrction Safety.
